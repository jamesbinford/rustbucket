# Instance Registration Design

## 1. Overview

Rustbucket includes a feature to allow individual honeypot instances to register themselves with a central registry server. This can be useful for tracking deployed instances, gathering basic metadata, or coordinating distributed honeypots.

The registration is performed by the `registration.rs` module. The main public function is `register_instance()`, which is an asynchronous function. This function is called automatically during startup from `src/main.rs` before the port listeners begin accepting connections.

## 2. Configuration

The registration process is configured via the `Config.toml` file, specifically within the `[registration]` section.

### `Config.toml` Structure:
```toml
[registration]
# URL of the central registry server where this instance should register.
rustbucket_registry_url = "http://your-registry.example.com/register"
```

-   **`rustbucket_registry_url`**: (Optional String) The full URL of the endpoint on the central registry server that handles new instance registrations.
    -   If this key is missing from `Config.toml` or the `[registration]` section itself is absent, the system will log a warning and fall back to a default URL (`http://localhost:8080/register` as defined in `src/registration.rs`).

### Configuration Loading:
The `register_instance()` function in `src/registration.rs` attempts to load this URL from `Config.toml`. If the file, section, or key is not found, or if there's an error parsing the configuration, it falls back to the default URL and logs the issue.

## 3. Registration Process

When `register_instance()` is called, it performs the following steps:

### 3.1. Generate Instance Identity
Two pieces of information are generated locally to identify the instance:

-   **Name**: A unique name for the honeypot instance.
    -   Format: `rustbucket-` followed by an 8-character alphanumeric random suffix (e.g., `rustbucket-aBcDeFgH`).
    -   Generated by `generate_name()` function using the `rand` crate.
-   **Token**: A secret token for the instance, potentially for future authentication with the registry.
    -   Format: A 32-character alphanumeric random string.
    -   Generated by `generate_token()` function using the `rand` crate.
    -   *Note: Currently, the token is logged for debugging purposes. This should be reviewed for production deployments.*

### 3.2. Prepare Payload
A JSON payload is constructed with the generated name and token.

**Payload Structure:**
```json
{
    "name": "<generated_name>",
    "token": "<generated_token>"
}
```
This is represented by the `RegistrationPayload` struct in `src/registration.rs`.

### 3.3. HTTP POST Request
An HTTP POST request is made to the configured `rustbucket_registry_url` (or the default if not configured).
-   The `Content-Type` of the request is `application/json`.
-   The body of the request is the JSON payload described above.
-   The request is made using the `reqwest` crate.

### 3.4. Handle Response
The system logs the outcome of the registration attempt based on the HTTP response from the registry server:

-   **Success (HTTP 200 OK)**: Logs a success message including the instance name and the server's response body.
-   **Failure (HTTP 404 Not Found)**: Logs an error indicating a bad URL.
-   **Failure (HTTP 500 Internal Server Error)**: Logs an error indicating a server-side issue at the registry.
-   **Other Statuses**: Logs a warning with the unexpected status code and response body.
-   **Request Error**: If the HTTP request itself fails (e.g., network issue, DNS failure), an error is logged detailing the failure.

## 4. Error Handling

The `registration.rs` module handles errors at several stages:

-   **Configuration Loading**: If `Config.toml` cannot be read or the `rustbucket_registry_url` is missing, a warning is logged, and the process continues with a default URL. Critical parsing errors might cause `register_instance` to use the default URL immediately.
-   **HTTP Request Failure**: Errors during the `reqwest::Client::post().send()` call (e.g., network errors) are caught and logged. The registration attempt is aborted for that cycle.
-   **Non-Successful HTTP Responses**: Specific HTTP error codes (404, 500) and other non-200 statuses are logged with details from the response.

The `register_instance()` function itself does not return a `Result` and is designed to complete without panicking the main application, logging its outcomes internally.

## 5. Security Considerations

-   **Token Security**: The generated token is currently logged. In a production environment, logging sensitive tokens should be avoided. The purpose and handling of this token by the registry server would also dictate security measures.
-   **Registry Endpoint Security**: The registry server endpoint (`rustbucket_registry_url`) should be secured (e.g., using HTTPS, authentication/authorization if necessary) to prevent unauthorized registrations or information leakage, though the current client implementation in `registration.rs` uses HTTP by default if the scheme is not specified in the URL.
-   **Data Exposure**: The instance name and token are sent to the registry. Consideration should be given to what information the registry stores and how it's protected.
-   **Default URL**: The fallback to `http://localhost:8080/register` might have security implications if a malicious service is running on that port on the honeypot host or a reachable network segment.

## 6. Future Enhancements

-   **Registry Authentication**: The client could use the generated token or other credentials to authenticate with the registry.
-   **Retry Logic**: Implement retry mechanisms with backoff for transient network errors or server unavailability.
-   **More Detailed Payload**: Include more instance details in the registration payload (e.g., version, uptime, active ports).
-   **Dynamic Configuration**: Allow enabling/disabling registration via `Config.toml`.
-   **Integration into Main Flow**: Provide a clear mechanism or configuration to automatically call `register_instance()` on startup if desired.
-   **Secure Token Handling**: Remove token logging in production and ensure secure transmission (HTTPS).
-   **Registry Discovery**: Implement a discovery mechanism if the registry URL is not static.
-   **Deregistration**: A way for instances to de-register.
